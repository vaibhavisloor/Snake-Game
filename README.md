# Snake Game

This is a classic Snake Game implemented in Python using the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) technique and the Turtle module.

## How to Play

- The objective of the game is to control the snake on the screen and help it eat the food.
- The snake will move continuously in the direction it is currently facing.
- Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to change the direction of the snake.
- The snake will grow longer each time it eats the food.
- The game ends if the snake hits the boundary or collides with its own body.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- The Turtle module is a built-in module in Python, so no additional installation is required.
